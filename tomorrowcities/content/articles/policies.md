### Policy 1: Land and tenure security program
When this policy applied, the code levels of the residential buildings are set to higher standards 
which effectively reduces the damage states during hazard simulations. Since this policy only changes
the code levels, the computing engine is required to run again to see its effect.

### Policy 2: State-led upgrading/retrofitting of low-income/informal housing
When applied, this policy increase the code level of the buildings located in low income A and B zones.
This effectively reduces the damage states, and hence several impact metrics, starting from building-level
metrics.
