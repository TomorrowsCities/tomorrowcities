## Tomorrow's Cities Decision Support Environment (TCDSE) Webapp v0.6
TCDSE is a web application designed to conduct computational tasks to generate information needed for decision mechanisms in designing future cities. The web application, which will be referred as TCDSE for short, contains a computational engine capable of executing several hazard scenarios on different exposure datasets and infrastructures. 

## Documentation
Documentation is moved to [TomorrowsCities Wiki Page](https://github.com/TomorrowsCities/tomorrowcities/wiki)

* "freqincome" attribute is added to building layer.
* Amazon S3 support to save session or policy database.
* The engine now can parse, display vulnerability curves located on [Global Vulnerability Model Reposity](https://github.com/gem/global_vulnerability_model) maintained by [Global Earthquake Model Foundation)](https://www.globalquakemodel.org/gem). To see the new fatures, download one of the XML files in  [Global Vulnerability Model Reposity](https://github.com/gem/global_vulnerability_model) and drag and drop to [Engine](/engine). The engine will read all the vulnerability functions defined in the XML file and display them. 
* basemap is changed to ESri.WorldImagery to see the landscapes especially rivers.
* utilities page is added.
* Excel to GeoJSON converted is added to utilities page.
* GeoTIFF support is added. 
* When an intensity layer is added via GeoTIFF format, only the non-zero intensity measure are retained by the engine.
* In map visualization of intensity layer, only the largest 500k points are displayed to render the map faster.
* rasterio.transform.xy function is replaced with a faster local implementation.
* Info box is added next to the map to see overall information and building/landuse details
when clicked.
* Implementation Capacity Score is added. If medium or low is selected, then building-level metrics is increased by 25% and 50%, respectively. If high is selected, there is no change in the metrics.

## Quickstart
* Download [Sample Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BGPZQ2IKJHY9ExOCCHcNNrCTioYZ8D1y/view?usp=sharing) to your local environment and unzip the archieve file.
* Go to [engine](/engine)
* Drag/drop necessary files to the drop zone of the engine and execute the engine. A sample session is displayed below. 
* The impact metrics will be immediately seen on the page.

In case the file names in the video are not clearly seen, they are: 

* nairobi_business_buildings.geojson
* nairobi_business_household.json
* nairobi_business_individual.json
* nairobi_earthquake_fragility.json
* nairobi_earthquake_intensity.geojson

The used files above satisfy minimum requirements to run Earthquake analysis on buildings.
